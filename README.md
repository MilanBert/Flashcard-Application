# Flashcard Application
### [Video Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/PN8m_HE0cKs)

This repository contains a project developed to practice building a full-stack web application using **React** for the frontend, **Node.js** for the backend, and **SQL** for database management. The project also served as an introduction to user authentication, dynamic data handling, and testing in a web development context.

## Key Features

- **User Management:** Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts. The application dynamically retrieves user IDs for personalized flashcard management.
- **Flashcard Functionality:** Allows users to create, edit, delete, and review flashcards, supporting efficient learning.
- **Database Integration:** Implements an SQL database to store user accounts and flashcard data securely.
- **Testing:** Focuses on ensuring robust functionality, including connecting and testing database operations.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the integration of React (frontend) and Node.js (backend) in a full-stack application.
- Gain hands-on experience in managing user input, authentication, and database interactions.
- Learn the basics of software testing, including debugging database connectivity issues.

## Team Collaboration

This project was developed as part of a team to practice **software engineering principles** and **Git workflows**. The focus was on:

- **Collaborative Development:** Using Git for version control, feature branching, and resolving merge conflicts.
- **Software Engineering Practices:** Adopting structured development workflows, code reviews, and incremental development to ensure high-quality and maintainable code.
- **Team Communication:** Strengthening collaboration and problem-solving skills while working in a group environment.

This project was an opportunity to explore core concepts in web development while building a practical tool for studying.
